						    		<h3>Exoplanet Host Stars and Their Planets</h3>
								<p> Exoplanets, at some point in time, have been under the influence of their host stars. As a result, almost all exoplanet properties are 
                  related to the stellar properties of their host. For example, the estimate of the planetary radius is a direct function of the usually 
                  unknown stellar radius and observed flux decrements of the star during transit. In addition to the relation of stellar properties to 
                  the planet, the ability to characterize the systems can be impacted by the planet detection method used, given that most detection methods 
                  are reliant on observing the host star directly. Methods for determining stellar radius, mass, composition, and temperature have been developed 
                  and improved with our increasing understanding of stars. Most stellar parameters are generally determined via indirect methods, relying 
                  on model fits to observables to calculate properties. However indirect methods, such as using stellar evolutionary models or stellar atmospheric models,
                  have been shown to have deficiencies, stemming from a variety of reasons (i.e. bias in input physics). Stellar evolutionary models have been shown to 
                  over-estimate temperatures of single K- and M-stars by ~3% and under-estimate radii by ~5%.</p>

                  <p>To overcome these discrepencies, one can use direct methods to study stars. I study stars using a method called long-baseline optical/near-IR interferometry, 
                  or LBOI. LBOI is a technique that combines light from multiple telescopes that are separated by a baseline, B. The resolution of an astronomical interferometer
                  is thus reliant on the the baseline, or the distance between the telescopes. Long-baseline optical interferometry provides for resolutions down to the 
                  sub-milliarcsecond range. XXX add more about interferometry and how it works
                    
                    LBOI was first used by Albert Michelson to measure the diameter of Betelgeuse in the early 1900s at Mt. Wilson Observatory in California. Since the early 1900s,
                    LBOI has become increasingly popular to study stars. As a side project, I compiled stars that have been measured with direct methods (mainly through optical interferometry) 
		    and created a HR diagram. This HR diagram consists of 693 unique stars that all have their radius, luminosity, and effective temperature directly determined. 
                    XXX insert HR diagram information here XXX
                  </p>

                  <p>I use this technique to study exoplanet host stars in particular. By being able to directly measure a star's angular diameter with LBOI, the stellar radius can be
                  determined in a model-independent way, removing any bias from a stellar evolutionary or atmospheric model. In addition to the stellar radius, a star's effective
                  temperature and luminosity can also be determined by using variations of the Stefan Boltzmann equation. So by directly measuring a star's angular diameter, we now
                  have 3 main stellar fundamental parameters that have been determined in a minimal model dependent or model independent way. And knowing that a planet's parameters are direct functions
                  of their host star, we can now constrain the planet parameters with much more certainty than before.
                  </p>
                  

                  <h4>Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array</h4>
                  <p>I work with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy or CHARA. CHARA is located on Mt. Wilson in California. The Array is made up of 6 1-meter telescopes arranged
                  in a Y-formation. It has a maximum baseline of ~330 meters, which results in resolutions reaching down to about ~0.3 mas. For context, the Hubble Space Telescope has a resolution
                  of 50 mas. With CHARA, for my dissertation, I am studying 3 exoplanet host stars (and then their planets): 51 Eridani, HD 219134, and HD 158259. 
                  </p>

                  <h3>My Dissertation Work</h3>
                  <p>I have completed a study on 51 Eridani, a very young star that is host to directly imaged planet 51 Eridani b. I used the CHARA Array to measure an angular diameter of 51 Eridani
                  and used the angular diameter to determine the star's radius, effective temperature, and luminosity, which are then also used to constrain an age and a mass of the star. The
                  determination of the stellar fundamental parameters are then used to constrain the planet's mass using iso-mass models. To learn more, read the paper here: XXXXX
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I am currently studying the HD 219134 system. HD 219134 is a bright, nearby K3V dwarf star that hosts 6* exoplanets. I am using observations taken with several beam-combiners at 
                    CHARA to measure an angular diameter of HD 219134. In order to properly measure an angular diameter, I developed a Python package called RADPY. See more about RADPy below. With a measured 
                    angular diameter, I have then been able to determine the star's effective temperature and luminosity. For the planets, I have compiled archival data which consists of ~30 years of radial velocity
                    monitoring and 5 sectors of TESS data. My goal is to solve for an orbital solution of this system using a modeling software called ExoFASTv2 XXXX(Citation). This will simultaneously
                    model radial velocity data and transit photometry data to solve for the exoplanet orbital solutions. I am using the directly determined stellar parameters as strict priors to perform this modeling.
                  </p>

                  <h3>RADPy</h3>
                  <p>As a part of my dissertation, I developed a robust fitting routine for multi-wavelength interferometric data from the CHARA Array called RADPy (or Robust Angular Diameters in Python). 
                    RADPy takes any combination of interferometric data and performs a Monte Carlo-based simulation that runs a custom-built bootstrapping routine within. The results of RADPy take into account
                    night-to-night variability, atmospheric effects, and uncertainties in the calibrator diameters, wavelength scale, measurement errors, limb-darkening coefficients, and correlations between wavelength channels. 
                  </p>

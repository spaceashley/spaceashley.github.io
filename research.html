						    		<h3>Exoplanet Host Stars and Their Planets</h3>
								<p> Exoplanets, at some point in time, have been under the influence of their host stars. As a result, almost all exoplanet properties are 
                  						    related to the stellar properties of their host. For example, the estimate of the planetary radius is a direct function of the usually 
                  						    unknown stellar radius and observed flux decrements of the star during transit. In addition to the relation of stellar properties to 
                  						    the planet, the ability to characterize the systems can be impacted by the planet detection method used, given that most detection methods 
                                                                    are reliant on observing the host star directly. Methods for determining stellar radius, mass, composition, and temperature have been developed 
                  						    and improved with our increasing understanding of stars. Most stellar parameters are generally determined via indirect methods, relying 
                                                                    on model fits to observables to calculate properties. However indirect methods, such as using stellar evolutionary models or stellar atmospheric models,
                                                                    have been shown to have deficiencies, stemming from a variety of reasons (i.e. bias in input physics). Stellar evolutionary models have been shown to 
                                                                    over-estimate temperatures of single K- and M-stars by ~3% and under-estimate radii by ~5% (See <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...757..112B/abstract">Boyajian et al. 2012</a>.)</p>

                                                                 <p>To overcome these discrepencies, one can use direct methods to study stars. I study stars using a method called long-baseline optical/near-IR interferometry, 
                       						    or LBOI. LBOI is a technique that combines light from multiple telescopes that are separated by a baseline, B. The resolution of an astronomical interferometer
                  						    is thus reliant on the the baseline, or the distance between the telescopes. Long-baseline optical interferometry is capable of attaining resolutions down to the 
                      						    sub-milliarcsecond range. With an astronomical interferometer, light from an object is collected at each telescope (or aperature). This light is sent into the beam-synthesis lab
								    where it is recombined. The recombined light produces a pattern known as interference fringes. Within the amplitude of these fringes, information about the object such as 
								    the size, shape, and brightness distribution. So by observing an object with LBOI, such as a star, one can directly measure the angular diameter of the object, image surface
							            features like star spots, observe planetary disks, and much more.</p>
                    
                    						    <p>LBOI was first used by Albert Michelson to measure the diameter of Betelgeuse in the early 1900s at Mt. Wilson Observatory in California. Since the early 1900s,
                                                                    LBOI has become increasingly popular to study stars. As a side project, I compiled stars that have been measured with direct methods (mainly through optical interferometry) 
		                                                    and created a HR diagram. This HR diagram consists of 693 unique stars that all have their radius, luminosity, and effective temperature directly determined. I made a few
		                                                    versions of this plot and more information can be found on the CHARA website. </p>

									The plot on the left shows the HR diagram with the size of the points scaled to the radius of the star. The color of the circles correspond to the spectral type (aka temperature/color)
									of the star. I created a color map designed to follow the spectral types/temperatures/colors of stars (will be available on GitHub soon). The dashed diagnonal lines represent lines of 
									constant radius. The plot in the middle shows a similar plot, but with the size of the points all uniform and some famous stars highlighted. Finally, the plot on the right shows a similar
									plot, with the size of the points scaled to the radius of the star. The colors of the points are also related to the spectral type. This plot highlights stars with known planets. There are
									84 stars that are exoplanet hosts.

                  						<p>I use this technique to study exoplanet host stars in particular. By being able to directly measure a star's angular diameter with LBOI, the stellar radius can be
                  						determined in a model-independent way, removing any bias from a stellar evolutionary or atmospheric model. In addition to the stellar radius, a star's effective
                  						temperature and luminosity can also be determined by using variations of the Stefan Boltzmann equation. So by directly measuring a star's angular diameter, we now
                  						have 3 main stellar fundamental parameters that have been determined in a minimal model dependent or model independent way. And knowing that a planet's parameters are direct functions
                  						of their host star, we can now constrain the planet parameters with much more certainty than before.
                  						</p>
                  

                  						<h4>Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array</h4>
                  							<p>I work with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy or CHARA. CHARA is located on Mt. Wilson in California. The Array is made up of 6 1-meter telescopes arranged
                  							in a Y-formation. It has a maximum baseline of ~330 meters, which results in resolutions reaching down to about ~0.3 mas. For context, the Hubble Space Telescope has a resolution
                 							 of 50 mas. With CHARA, for my dissertation, I am studying 3 exoplanet host stars (and then their planets): 51 Eridani, HD 219134, and HD 158259. 
                 							 </p>

                  						<h3>My Dissertation Work</h3>
                  							<p>I have completed a study on 51 Eridani, a very young star that is host to directly imaged planet 51 Eridani b. I used the CHARA Array to measure an angular diameter of 51 Eridani
                  							and used the angular diameter to determine the star's radius, effective temperature, and luminosity, which are then also used to constrain an age and a mass of the star. The
                  							determination of the stellar fundamental parameters are then used to constrain the planet's mass using iso-mass models. To learn more, click the button below:

                  							<p>
                    							I am currently studying the HD 219134 system. HD 219134 is a bright, nearby K3V dwarf star that hosts 6* exoplanets. I am using observations taken with several beam-combiners at 
                    							CHARA to measure an angular diameter of HD 219134. In order to properly measure an angular diameter, I developed a Python package called <code>RADPy</code>. See more about <code>RADPy</code> below. With a measured 
                    							angular diameter, I have then been able to determine the star's effective temperature and luminosity. For the planets, I have compiled archival data which consists of ~30 years of radial velocity
                    							monitoring and 5 sectors of TESS data. My goal is to solve for an orbital solution of this system using a modeling software called <code>ExoFASTv2</code>(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190709480E/abstract">Eastman et al. 2019</a>. 
									This will simultaneously model radial velocity data and transit photometry data to solve for the exoplanet orbital solutions. I am using the directly determined stellar parameters as strict priors to perform this modeling.
                  							</p>

                  						<h3>Robust Angular Diameters in Python (<code>RADPy</code>)</h3>
                  							<p>As a part of my dissertation, I developed a robust fitting routine for multi-wavelength interferometric data from the CHARA Array called <code>RADPy</code>. 
                    							<code>RADPy</code> takes any combination of interferometric data and performs a Monte Carlo-based simulation that runs a custom-built bootstrapping routine within. The results of RADPy take into account
                    							night-to-night variability, atmospheric effects, and uncertainties in the calibrator diameters, wavelength scale, measurement errors, limb-darkening coefficients, and correlations between wavelength channels. 
									<code>RADPy</code> is available to download using <code>pip</code>! To learn more about it, click the button below:
